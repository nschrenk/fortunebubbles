Fortune Bubbles
===============

Fortune Bubbles game, made over a period of 2 days at Game Jam 2014 St Louis.
This was our first experience with OpenFL, and it probably shows!

To build this you need to have OpenFL installed. See more details at openfl.org.

Once you have OpenFL installed, "lime test neko" will run the game, and
"lime build html5" will build a web version.
